## Project Overview: Insurance Survey Form

## Purpose:
The Insurance Survey Form is designed to collect essential user information for insurance purposes. It includes fields for personal details, insurance preferences, and conditional questions based on user responses.

## Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the basic structure of the form.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface:

Clean and simple layout for easy navigation.
Form fields include full name, email, age, gender, type of insurance, and existing insurance status.
Conditional Logic:

If the user has existing insurance, additional questions about the vehicle type are displayed.
If the user does not have existing insurance, a field to provide a reason is shown.
Form Validation:

Ensures all required fields are filled out before submission.
Alerts users if any required information is missing.
Dynamic Content Display:

Upon successful form submission, the form fades out, and a success message with a summary of the provided information is displayed.
The user's name is personalized in the success message, and a discount code is provided as a thank-you gesture.
Responsive Design:

The form is styled using CSS to be visually appealing and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
Implementation Details:

## HTML Structure:
Form elements and conditional sections are defined with appropriate input types and attributes.
## CSS Styling:
Flexbox is used for centering the form.
Animations and transitions enhance user interaction.
## JavaScript Functionality:
Event listeners handle changes in radio button selections to toggle visibility of conditional fields.
Form submission is intercepted to run validation checks before displaying the success message.
The form summary is dynamically generated based on user input.

## Conclusion:
The Insurance Survey Form project effectively combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive, user-friendly web form. It demonstrates the integration of these technologies to build a functional and visually appealing web application.
